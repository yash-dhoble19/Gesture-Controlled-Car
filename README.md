# Gesture-Controlled-Car
 This project demonstrates a **gesture-controlled robot car** powered by an **ESP32** and a **laptop camera**.   The car connects to Wi-Fi and listens for **UDP packets** containing driving commands (`f, b, l, r, s`).   A Python script uses **MediaPipe Hands** to track gestures in real-time and sends these commands over the network.
